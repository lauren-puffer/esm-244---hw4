# Overview

### Purpose of Analysis

With this analysis, we aim to assess possible temporal trends of Coho salmon, jack Coho salmon, and Steelhead trout in the Columbia River Basin. Our analysis will use a simple data manipulation in the 'lubridate' package for compatibility with visualization tools. We will then explore patterns in seasonality and overall trends, as well as compare fish counts by month using 'ggsubseries.'

### Data citation {#Male Coho salmon (Courtesy of CA Sea Grant)}

Data were shared by and accessed from [Columbia River DART](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_graph_text) (Data Access in Real Time), accessed January 25, 2023. This data comes from a collaboration of 8 entities monitoring fish populations in the Columbia Basin. Fish counts for 9 species and water temperature is recorded daily.

### Pseudocode

1.  Load necessary packages, including fable and feast
2.  Read in the data and pivot longer to create distinct columns for type and count
3.  Put data into a tsibble table for ease of use with time-series data
4.  Plot daily counts of entire study to look for temporal trends in data
5.  Convert data into week-year format and plot for seasonality
6.  Convert data into year format and plot abundances across year

## Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(dplyr) #change NAs to zeros
library(tsibble) #make a dataframe
library(lubridate) #used for altering time series data
library(feasts) 
library(fable)
library(patchwork)
```

## Data wrangling

Because we are working with time-series data, we need to make sure that all of our observations are in tidy form. This means NAs must be changed to zero values, each row must represent its own observation, and 'date' must be in the proper format (year-month-day).

```{r load data and prepare for time series analysis}
# load data from local file
fish_data <- read.csv(here("data", "willamette_fish_passage.csv")) |>
  clean_names() |>
  mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0))|>  #change NA values to zeros 
  select(date, steelhead, coho, jack_coho)|>
  mutate(date = mdy(date))


#create a distinct dataframe with species in 1 column and fish count in another column  
fish_data_long <- fish_data|> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(jack_coho, coho, steelhead), 
               names_to= "type", 
               values_to = "count")

# create a tsibbble table ofr usability 
fish_ts <- fish_data_long |>
  as_tsibble(key = type, #not more than one variable dertmining time indeces
             index = date) #use date to specify time

```

## Overall Temporal Trends

In order to observe the general trends in the data, we must look at observations through a broader lens. For this reason, we will plot daily counts of jack Coho, Coho, and Steelhead by type across year. This will also us to make inferences about what could be governing the presence/absence and overall abundance of each fish type in the Columbia River Basin.

```{r plot data}
#| fig-cap: "Fig. 1 - Daily fish counts for adult Steelhead trout, jack Coho salmon, and Coho salmon observed in the Columbia River Basin."

ggplot(data = fish_ts, 
       aes(x = date, y = count, colour = type)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Daily Counts",
       title = "Daily Counts by Type") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("steelhead" = "goldenrod1", 
                                "jack_coho" = "deeppink3", 
                                "coho" = "chartreuse3")) +  # Custom colors
  theme_classic()

```

### Explanation of trends

-   Abundances Coho salmon in the basin spiked in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The seasonality for Steelhead and Coho salmon seem to alternate. When counts for Steelhead are low or near zero, Coho counts increase.

-   Coho abundances seemed to increase over time each year, with the highest abundances occurring in the last year of the study (2010). This could be because of an increased effort to populate watersheds with hatchery-raised Coho salmon.

-   Jack Coho salmon tend to have lower numbers than regular Coho salmon. This is important to their life history strategy, as jack Coho salmon are males disguised as females that "sneak in" to breed with females. If their numbers get too high, they lose their competitive edge.

## Seasonality

We will make seasonality plots to see how abundances (counts) each fish type tend to behave on a year-long scale. For a better visualization, fish counts will be summed over each week of the study and then plotted as a line graph.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Fig. 2 - Weekly abundances for adult jack Coho salmon, Coho salmon, and Steelhead trout observed in the Columbia River Basin across study years. Note: Range of count values varies. Data across type are not scaled."
#| 
# weekly coho jack 
jack_week <- fish_ts |> 
  filter(type == "jack_coho") |>
  index_by(week = ~yearweek(.)) |> #use yearweek to convert date
  summarize(weekly_count = mean(count, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
      ungroup() 

#plots seasonal average across year
jack_season <- jack_week|>
  gg_season(y = weekly_count) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "", title= "Jack Coho salmon") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 


#do the same for coho
coho_week <- fish_ts |> 
  filter(type == "coho") |>
  index_by(week = ~yearweek(.)) |> #use yearweek to convert date
  summarize(weekly_count = mean(count, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
      ungroup() 

#plots seasonal average across year
coho_season <- coho_week|>
  gg_season(y = weekly_count) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Weekly Count", title = "Coho salmon") +
  theme_minimal()

#do the same for steelhead
steelhead_week <- fish_ts |> 
  filter(type == "steelhead") |>
  index_by(week = ~yearweek(.)) |> #use yearweek to convert date
  summarize(weekly_count = mean(count, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
      ungroup() 

#plots seasonal average across year
steelhead_season <- steelhead_week |>
  gg_season(y = weekly_count) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Month", y = "", title = "Steelhead trout") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

patch <- jack_season/coho_season/steelhead_season

print(patch)
```

### Explanation of trends

-   There is much more variation in weekly Steelhead trout abundance compared with jack Coho and Coho salmon in the first half of the year. Steelhead trout tend to maintain higher abundances for a larger portion of the year compared with the Coho salmon types. This trend may be explained by the fact that Coho salmon must leave the river when they reach maturity and the don't return until it is time for them to breed. Steelhead on the other hand, do not have to leave the river at any particular time. In fact, a Steelhead that remains in the river its whole life is effectively what we call a Rainbow trout.

-   Steelhead and Coho, are their reproduction strategy. Salmon reproduce only once and only make 1 journey to the ocean before returning back to spawn. After salmon spawn, they die. Steelhead are able to go back and forth from the ocean, and can breed more than once. The larger abundance of Steelhead could be explained by this unique life history strategy.

-   This data was collected at a "fish ladder," in Willamette Falls. This is important to note because fish ladders are a type of fish passages used to aid in the migration of anadromous fishes like Coho and Steelhead. Salmon (like Coho) have certain seasons where the "run" from river to ocean, or ocean to river. The spike in observations of both types of Coho salmon likely corresponds with the Salmon run season which occurs in the fall for Coho salmon.

## Annual Counts

In order to observe how fish abundances for jack Coho, Coho, and Steelhead are changing over time, we will plot their abundance for each year across the 10 years of the study. We will use a stacked bar graph to illustrate these trends.\

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Fig. 3 - Annual abundances for adult jack Coho salmon, Coho salmon, and Steelhead trout observed in the Columbia River Basin across study years."
#| 
#create a dataframe with salmon type, yearly count, and year
fish_year <- fish_ts |> 
  group_by(type) |>  #Group by 'type' before summarizing
  index_by(year = ~year(.)) |> #get time series data by year (10 years)
  summarize(yearly_count = mean(count, na.rm = TRUE)) |> #create yearly count column
  ungroup()

#create bar graph of abundance by year colored by 'type'
fish_year_abundance <- ggplot(fish_year, aes(x = year, y = yearly_count, fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Yearly Average Count", title = "Salmon Abundance by Year and Type") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(fish_year$year), max(fish_year$year), by = 1)) + #continuous x-axis
  theme_minimal() 
  
  fish_year_abundance

```

### Explanation of trends

-   Coho abundance seemed to increase towards the end of the study. This is consistent with the information represented in our seasonality plot. This could be the result of increased protections for the species as many populations of Coho salmon are threatened or endangered.

-   When Coho abundances are higher, so are jack Coho Salmon abundances. This pattern appears to be proportional. Given that jack Coho numbers shouldn't be higher than regular Coho, it makes sense that there are almost no jacks in the years that saw lower Coho abundance.

-   It is possible that Steelhead trout exhibit a cyclical pattern across year that we cannot see given the discrete amount of time that this data was collected within. The large swings in abundance between year do not show any obvious trend, but LTER could reveal different pattern that occur over a larger time scale than one decade.

## Discussion

Salmonids face many barriers when it comes to migration. The data collected at this fish ladder is representative of the fish that were able to make it as far as the ladder during their migration. Although we cannot say for certain what will happen to abundance of salmonids in the Columbia River Basin, the small-scale seasonal trends and temporal variation in fish types across the 10 years of this study are consistent with what we know about salmonid life history strategies. Increased protection of threatened and endangered species of Coho salmon could explain the significant increase in their abundance over time. In 2023, the fish ladder at Willamette falls saw its highest abundance of Coho salmon on record.

When establishing policies to improve the overall abundances of these species, it is important to consider their life history strategies. Time-series data like this can also inform the fishing practices and natural resource use regulations of the area to minimize impact on the environment. Future analysis should explore data collected over a time period which is longer than 10 years, specifically to explain the variation in Steelhead trout.
